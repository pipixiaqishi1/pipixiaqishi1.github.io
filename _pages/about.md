# 👨‍🎓 About Me
I am a MS student at Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. [Xiu Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Xrh1OIUAAAAJ&hl=en). Currently, I am fortunate to work closely with [Dr. Chenjia Bai](https://baichenjia.github.io/) as an intern at Shanghai AI Lab.

My research interests lie in efficient decision-making systems with powerful generalization and robustness. I primarily focus on:
* Deep Reinforcement Learning and Its Real-world Applications.
* Visual Foundation Models and Large Language Models for Decision Making.
